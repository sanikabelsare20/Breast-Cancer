ü©∫ Breast Cancer Classification: A GUI-Based Approach


Project Overview

Breast Cancer Classification: A GUI-Based Approach is a deep learning-driven application designed to classify
breast cancer from mammographic images. The project employs advanced image processing and deep learning techniques
to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast cancer effectively.

This project provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Streamlit, with a robust backend 
powered by MongoDB, and is deployed on a freely available cloud platform.

üöÄ Features

Image Upload: Supports JPEG format mammographic images.

Feature Extraction: 

Automatically extracts important features such as:
breast_density	,left_or_right_breast, 	image_view,	abnormality_id,	abnormality_type,	mass_shape,	mass_margins,	 pathology. 

Model Comparison: Uses three deep learning models:
VGG16 (Best Performance)
ResNet50
MobileNet


Prediction: Provides clear classification results.
Interactive GUI: Easy-to-use interface with Streamlit.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit, HTML, CSS
Backend: JavaScript
Deep Learning Models: VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet
Image Processing: OpenCV, PIL


üß† How It Works
Image Input: Upload a mammographic image.
Feature Extraction: Automatically extracts critical features.
Model Prediction: Uses the best-suited deep learning model (VGG16) to classify the image.
Display Results: Shows the prediction results and stores them in MongoDB.

üí° Usage
Launch the Streamlit app.
Upload a mammographic image.
View the classification result.


üìà Results
VGG16: Best classification performance.
ResNet50 & MobileNet: Used for comparative analysis.
